        <h1>LOOK, SORRY IN ADVANCE IF THIS FEELS BAD, BUT I'M GATHERING COURAGE<b>(HIMMAT)</b> TO TELL YOU, REST IS YOUR
            DECISION</h1>

        <p>I want to start by saying that I am sorry for what you are going to read here. Please understand that I am sharing
            this with you because it’s important to me.</p>

        <p>maybe i can loose a good friend after that but Risk is always better then regret, and i will take that risk
            because i dont want to loose you at any cost, Dekh phr sorry bol rha hu hn yr, boht himmat krke bol rha hu
            dkhlio thoda So, theek </p>

        <p> Dekh sun yr kiya chal rha hai dimag mai boht dino sai while this might make things complicated, it’s
            something I need to say.
        </p>

        <p>you are perfect for me. I accept you just the way you are—your annoying, your
            attitude, everything. I enjoy talking to you, and no matter what you call me or how you behave, it’s all
            fine with me. I don't know if you like me, but I am just sharing what’s in my mind. If anything I say
            bothers you, I apologize in advance.</p>

        <p>I have liked you for quite some time now. Like you mentioned before, I didn't have the courage to approach
            you directly, but over time, I realized that you are exactly the person I have always wanted. I knew from
            the moment we met on 28th February, and the time we spent together confirmed it. I made up my mind then—I
            want you at any cost.</p>

        <p>I believe you know enough about me by now. Everything I have said so far is true.</p>

        <p>Now, the most important question: If you accept me, and if everything goes smoothly, will you marry me? I am
            asking you directly because, I have time to wait, I know you dont have that much time.
            Please take your time to think about it, and dont make any decision in rush wait as much you want pr jldi hi
            bata bhi dio yr.</p>

        <p>I am giving my full effort to achieve 100% career in trading, and I will do it. It's not gambling, it's
            trading. It may take some time to settle down in this, but if needed, I can also leave my job. So, it’s
            possible that after a few months, there could be some financial problems, but I will try my best to keep you
            happy at all times. Nothing will change between us; both professional and personal life will be managed
            perfectly.</p>

        <p>However, if you say "No," I want you to know that I won’t force myself into your life anymore. I have liked
            you for a long time, and I like you deeply. But whatever decision you make, I will accept it gracefully.</p>

        <p>After that, we may be not talk again, or perhaps we will speak occasionally or rarely. Just remember, I
            will always be your best friend. Whenever you need help with anything, I am only a phone call away.</p>
